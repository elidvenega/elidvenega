						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>I'm a self taught web developer who loves technology and like's to challenging myself
							by learning new technologies I have always had an interest in computers. But did not know
							what to do with until I saw a documentary talking about computers "Triumph of the Nerd"
							 I saw Bill Gates talking about computers and the impact they would have on people every day lives.
							 Like Steve Jobs to Larry Ellison, Elon Musk I just got hook with computers and programming since I'm 
							 on a computer every day I thought to myself "might as well learn how computers work" I'm on a 
							 journey of learning since things change often in web development.

						<h3>Guitar</h3>
						<p>One of my favorite things to do is play guitar I love music all from
							blues to jazz, bachata and rock n roll music connects everyone and is
							a universal language. My favorite guitar player Eric Clapton
						 a blues man from England who rose to fame in the 1960's with his band Cream he 
						 redifined what an electric guitar should sound like. A lot of great guitar
						players came from that era some of the best from Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck thse were some of
					the first virtuoso's for guitar all the riffs they came up are recognizable and became classics
				and thanks to them blues became popular in England. </p>

						<h3>Anime</h3>
						<p> I really like to watch is anime ever since I was a kid I remember coming
							home from school to watch Dragon Ball Z it was my favorite show. I like watching the fights Goku had
							with the villains and watching him go super saiyan and as I got older I started watching different type's of anime 
							from many different genre's. A good anime to watch is Guilty Crown it has everything from action 
							to romance it follow's the lead character name Shu and the girl he loves Inori as they tried to 
							save the world.
						</p>

						<p>
							The picture is about a new anime Boruto who is the son of Naruto who is the Hokage and the
							previous main character of Naruto Shippuden. Is a tale of a young orphan kid who had a demon sealed inside
							him and because of that everybody hated him  so in order to prove himself he decides he
							will become the Hokage the strongest ninja in the village. Despite all the odd's he becomes the best ninja and greatest
							 Hokage and now his son has his own challenges but just like the dad he will over come them.
