						<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p>I'm a self taught web developer who likes technology and like challenging myself
							by learning new techniques. I have always had an interest in computers but did not know
							what to do with until I saw a documentary talking about computers "Triumph of the Nerd".
							Then I saw Bill Gates talking about computers and how much fascinated he was with computers
							from Steve Jobs to Larry Ellison, Elon Musk I just got hook with computers and programming.
						</p>
						<p>I have seen so many YouTubers how they learn to program and change there live and have
							been able to help there family members. What I want to do the most with this is help my
							mom and make her proud and would like this dream come true.

						<h3>Anime</h3>
						<p>One of the things I really like to watch is anime ever since I was a kid I remember coming
							home from
							school to watch Dragon Ball Z. It was my favorite show I like watching the fights Goku had
							with the villains
							and watching him go super saiyan and as I got older I was watching different type of genre
							of anime and one of
							my favorite genre is romance.
						</p>

						<p>
							The picture is about the new anime Boruto who is the son of Naruto who is the Hokage and the
							previous main
							character of Naruto Shippuden. Is a tale of a young orphan kid who was demon sealed inside
							him and beccause
							of that nobody likes him in fact they hate him so in order to prove himself he decides he
							will become
							the Hokage. Despite all the odd's he becomes the best ninja and greatest Hokage and now his
							son has his challenges
							but like the dad he will over come them.
